          There are many reasons to learn to scuba dive, from the interaction
          with underwater creatures such as coral, fish, turtles, seals and
          sometimes even sharks or large marine mammals, to the tranquility and
          freedom being under the water can give you, scuba diving is one of the
          most incrediable adventures you will ever experience!
          <br />
          Not only all that, but diving can be done all over the globe and in
          different climates, and at different times of the year you get a
          different experience so there's something new to be seen and learnt
          every time you go!
          <br />
          As well as the interaction with marine wildlife
          scuba diving brings, gaining your open water licence allows you to
          actively participate in preserving and protecting these vunerable
          underwater habitats both locally and globally. Project Aware connects
          the passion for diving with the purpose of marine conservation.
          Working towards a cleaner, healthier ocean they advance programs that
          address the greatest threats facing the ocean and you can be a part of
          this! From planting coral, to collecting plastic from the ocean floor
          there's plenty for divers to do to help protect the underwater
          habitats of the creatures that live there. Over 300 million tons of
          plastic are produced every year for use in a wide variety of
          applications. At least 8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans
          every year, and make up 80% of all marine debris from surface waters
          to deep-sea sediments. Marine species ingest or are entangled by
          plastic debris, which causes severe injuries and deaths. Tropical
          coral reefs are the most diverse marine ecosystems on earth, giving
          shelter to thousands of animal species. Many millions of people depend
          on fisheries, tourism and coastal protection provided by healthy coral
          reefs. Yet today, coral reefs are dying at an alarming rate all around
          the globe Corals build the reef structure and provide the basis for a
          functioning coral reef ecosystem. Without corals, reefs will degrade
          and vanish within years. At present, coral reefs are facing multiple
          stresses such as pollution, overfishing, and, overall, the ongoing
          climate change―consequently raising sea water temperatures and causing
          coral bleaching worldwide. As a result, over 50 percent of the world’s
          coral reefs have died in the last 30 years and up to 90 percent may
          die within the next century—very few pristine coral reefs still exist.
          With those facts, who wouldnt want to get involved?!

          And it's not just the wildlife that benefit!
          <br />
          Whilst diving you will meet like-minded individuals who share a common passion and
          this makes you feel part of a community. It is always easy to make
          friends and meet new people. Moreover, diving promotes camaraderie,
          equality and empowerment. Breathing slowly and deeply, which is whats
          done when you dive, allows you to get into a calm, relaxing state of
          mind. This contributes to a positive attitude and can prevent
          depression.

           What a mental health boost!
          Seawater is particularly beneficial to the skin, increasing its
          elasticity and improving its outer appearance. At the same time,
          sunlight gives a boost to your vitamin D levels that are essential for
          the absorption of calcium in the bones to make them healthier and
          stronger. Vitamin D does not only increase the rate of absorption of
          calcium, it also helps the cells pass calcium to each other. This
          higher absorption rate of calcium helps to keep the bones healthy and
          strong. Exposure to sunlight also helps to increase endorphin
          production within our brains, which generates feelings of joy and
          happiness. Diving improves self-perception due to the fact that it
          happens in an environment that is different from ours – the sea – and
          being able to handle it makes you feel confident and fulfilled! Diving
          can also help with emotional wellbeing, stress and can improve
          concentration capacity! It is proven that in one hour of scuba diving
          you burn abound 500 calories, which is as much as a one hour work out
          on cardio in the gym! Because of the natural resistance of water you
          train your muscles moving around, and you probably don’t even notice.
          While you are looking around and enjoying the marine life, you train
          your core, back muscles and glutes, effortlessly! Not to mention when
          you have to carry all your tanks and weights, which is basically the
          same as lifting weights. Not to mention other physical benefits such
          as...
