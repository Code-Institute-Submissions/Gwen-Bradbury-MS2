## Into The Blue.

![Apple Devices Picture](./wireframes/)

This is my second milestone project; Designed to exhibit my capabilities and skills in javascript, as a student 
of Code Institute. (https://codeinstitute.net/)
The goal was to showcase my skills to potential employers/recruiters, on a topic that I'm deeply interested in.
My project allows users to discover new divesites within the UK, inspiring them to dive in new locations and more frequently.

## UX.

The purpose of the site is to provide a simple, easy to use format presenting information about some of the UK's best divesites.
My website is designed for people interested in diving, specifically diving in the UK, and im hopeful my website 
will give them the motivation towards getting into the water more often and diving somewhere new.

 ## Deployment.

1. Created a Github account at https://github.com
  My account url;    https://github.com/Gwen-Bradbury

2. I uploaded all files to my Github repository located at this url; https://github.com/Gwen-Bradbury/MS2  which is for this individual project.

3. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it.  Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://gwen-bradbury.github.io/MS2/

4.  To run this code on your local machine, you would go to my respository at 
https://github.com/Gwen-Bradbury/MS2  and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;
  * Open Git Bash
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  * Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/Gwen-Bradbury/MS2.git      Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
